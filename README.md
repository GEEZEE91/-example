# Work Day Planner / To Do List 


##About The Project
  
  Work Day Calendar Application that enables user to schedule and save tasks for each hour of the work day. 

  The events entered are stored in the browsers local storage, thus ensuring the events are saved even if the browser is refreshed or closed.

  The app will highlight the current hour so that scheduled task for that hour can be highlighted.

  App can be used and accessed via any browser. 

The code is simple and short thanks to a number of API scripts being called upon including Bootstrap for the CSS, and jQuery & Moment. In addition to the html, css and js to perform it's scheduling function. JSON is used to ensure that the events we record in the planner are locally stored and the data will persist over a browser refresh for later use.

#Usage
This project can be used by anyone who wishes to visually keep track of their work tasks over the day. The scheduler has a row to represent each hour of the typical workday (i.e., 9AM to 5PM) where the user can enter and save tasks for that given hour. Each hour is color-coded based on whether it has passed, is current, or is in the future.
